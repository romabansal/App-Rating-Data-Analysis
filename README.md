# App-Rating-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes a publicly available dataset of app ratings from the Google Play Store using Python and Pandas. The project includes code for loading and cleaning the data, calculating basic statistics, creating visualizations, and drawing conclusions based on the analysis.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to download the dataset from Kaggle and have Python and Pandas installed on your machine.

# Once you have downloaded the dataset, you can load it into a Pandas DataFrame using the following code:

import pandas as pd
 
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("googleplaystore.csv")

# Print the first five rows
print(df.head())

Cleaning the Data : The dataset may contain duplicates or missing values, so it is important to clean the data before analyzing it. To remove duplicates and missing values, you can use the following code:
# Drop duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(subset="App", inplace=True)

# Drop rows with missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

Analyzing the Data : Once the data is clean, you can start analyzing it. The code in this project includes examples of how to calculate basic statistics such as the average rating and number of downloads for each app category:
# Calculate the average rating and number of downloads for each app category
category_stats = df.groupby("Category").agg({"Rating": "mean", "Installs": "sum"})
category_stats.rename(columns={"Rating": "Average Rating", "Installs": "Total Downloads"}, inplace=True)

# Print the results
print(category_stats)

# You can also create visualizations to help understand the data better, such as histograms and scatter plots:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a histogram of the app ratings
df.hist(column="Rating")

# Create a scatter plot of the app ratings versus the number of downloads
plt.scatter(df["Installs"], df["Rating"])
plt.xlabel("Number of Downloads")
plt.ylabel("Rating")

# Conclusions
Based on the analysis, you can draw several conclusions about the dataset. For example, you can see that the average rating is highest for apps in the "Events" and "Education" categories, while the total number of downloads is highest for apps in the "Communication" and "Social" categories. You can also see that there is a positive correlation between the number of downloads and the app rating, although the relationship is not linear.

This project demonstrates how to use Python and Pandas to analyze app rating data and draw meaningful insights. With further analysis and refinement, this data could be used to optimize app development and marketing strategies.
